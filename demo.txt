I will now begin reading the document for you. 
Please listen carefully as I go through the content, ensuring you understand each section. 
If the document is long, I will read it section by section to make it easier to follow. 
You can take notes, just relax and listen, or ask me to repeat any section by restarting the process.

This feature allows you to consume information hands-free, whether you are studying, 
working, or simply reviewing important documents. If there are multiple pages,
I will continue reading them one after another. 
While I read, make sure you stay focused so you donâ€™t miss any key details.

If you need to read another document, simply provide the file name, 
and I will process it for you. Remember, this is designed to make reading easier, 
especially for lengthy texts, research papers, or study materials.

Now, I will begin reading the first section of your document.
If you need me to slow down or adjust the reading speed in future sessions,
you can modify the settings. Sit back, relax, and let me assist you in reading your document.
